Employee monthly income is a critical metric that intersects various facets of compensation structure, talent acquisition, organizational management, and labor economics. Drawing from my background in labor force research and talent analytics, I utilized advanced data analytics techniques in this project to identify key metrics and developed Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost models. These models successfully predicted employee Monthly Income with over 99% predictive power.

The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset (2023) was used in this project.
